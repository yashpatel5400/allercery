## Credit
Special credit to: https://github.com/s9xie/hed. The final HED segmentation code (hed.py) was a result of their developed pre-trained model and associated execution code, meaning we greatly relied on their results for completing our project. The below is documentation given on their page, which shows what must be downloaded and some sample results:

### Introduction:

<img src="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/hed.jpg" width="400">

We use a new edge detection algorithm, holistically-nested edge detection (HED), fully described by: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06375. We owe these excellent results fully to: Saining Xie at UC San Diego

### Pretrained model

We provide the pretrained model and training/testing code for the edge detection framework Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED).
  0. Download the pretrained model (56MB) from (http://vcl.ucsd.edu/hed/hed_pretrained_bsds.caffemodel) and place it in examples/hed/ folder (will be downloaded automatically when the code is run if not already).

### Installing 
 0. Install prerequisites for Caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prequequisites)
 1. Caffe: install from https://github.com/BVLC/caffe

### Acknowledgment: 
This code is taken from a pretrained HED. Special thanks to:

This code is based on Caffe. Thanks to the contributors of Caffe. Thanks @shelhamer and @longjon for providing fundamental implementations that enable fully convolutional training/testing in Caffe.
